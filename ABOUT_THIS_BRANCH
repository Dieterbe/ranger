I put my personal branch online, maybe you find some of the
parts useful. To see whats different, type:

git diff master..hut

This branch is being regularily rebased on the master branch,
which rewrites history, so maybe its better to pick single commits
from this branch into your own branch rather than working directly
on this one:

git log master..hut
# search for a commit you like, write down SHA1 identifier
git checkout <your branch>
git cherry-pick <SHA1 of the commit>
