Installing
==========

You don't need to install anything.

You can run ranger by simply starting the executable file ranger.py
in the top directory of this package.
Use the --clean option and it will leave no trace whatsoever on your system.


If you insist on conventionally install it, use the package manager
of your operating system.  If there is no package or it is out of date,
you can also follow these instructions:


Step by step
============

(This is all done automagically if you type `sudo make install',
though you might want to read the Makefile first)

0. Make sure you have a recent version of python, including the
   curses module, which is the case if this shell command prints no errors:
   python -c 'import curses, sys; assert sys.version >= "2.6"'


1. Copy the file "ranger.py" into any of the directories in the PATH
   environment variable, for example to "/usr/bin/ranger"


2. Copy the directory "ranger" into one of the python module search
   paths, for example to "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ranger".

   Ensure that the path is listed by the command:
   python -c 'import sys; print("\n".join(sys.path))'


Uninstalling
============

Use your package manager to uninstall ranger.  If you manually installed
it, revert the steps described above.

Ranger can also create a configuration directory at ~/.ranger which
you might want to remove as well.
