Ranger v.1.1.0
==============

Ranger is a free console file manager that gives you greater flexibility
and a good overview of your files without having to leave your *nix console.
It visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory hierarchy
on one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right so you know
where you'll be going.  The default keys are similar to those of Vim, Emacs
and Midnight Commander, though Ranger is easily controllable with just the
arrow keys or the mouse.

The program is written in Python (2.6 or 3.1) and uses curses for the
text-based user interface.

Getting Started
---------------

Ranger can be started without installing.  Just run the executable (in
a terminal.)  The switch "--clean" will prevent it from creating or
accessing configuration files.

Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file for installing ranger.

After starting ranger, you should see 4 columns. The third one is the main
column, the directory where you're currently at.  To the left you see the
parent directories and to the right there's a preview of the object you're
pointing at.  Now use the Arrow Keys to navigate, Enter to open a file
or type Q to quit.

To customize ranger, copy the files from ranger/defaults/ to ~/.ranger/
and modify them according to your wishes.


Troubleshooting, Getting Help
-----------------------------

If you encounter an error, try running ranger with --debug.  This will
sometimes display more detailed information about the error.  Also, try
deactivating optimization:

PYTHONOPTIMIZE="" ranger --debug
