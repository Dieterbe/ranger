This is the default configuration file of ranger.

There are two ways of customizing ranger.  The first and recommended
method is creating a file at ~/.ranger/options.py and adding
those lines you want to change.  It might look like this:

from ranger.api.options import *
preview_files = False  # I hate previews!
max_history_size = 2000  # I can afford it.

The other way is directly editing this file.  This will make upgrades
of ranger more complicated though.

Whatever you do, make sure the import-line stays intact and the type
of the values stay the same.
